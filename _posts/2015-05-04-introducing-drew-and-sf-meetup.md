Hi!  I'm Drew Fisher, and I'm thrilled to announce that I'm the newest sandcat
on the block!  I'll be working on various parts of Sandstorm's software
platform, developer tools, and user experience.

A little bit about me:

  - I've done triage for [KDE](https://www.kde.org/), maintained Free Software
    reverse-engineered drivers for the
    [Kinect depth camera](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) and
    [Microsoft Touch Mouse](https://github.com/zarvox/libtouchmouse), and
    given a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMf55KVDPaE)
    at the 28th Chaos Communication Congress.
  - While at Texas A&M University, I led the Texas A&M University 
    [Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition](http://www.nationalccdc.org/) team
    to nationals, ran a campus mirror of a number several Linux distribution
    archives, and was active in the local Linux Users Group.
  - At UC Berkeley, I earned my MS in computer science studying security and
    human-computer interaction under [Dave Wagner](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/).
  - I've built secure, private, and user-friendly collaboration tools at
    [AeroFS](https://www.aerofs.com/).
  - In my free time, I [play](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/) and
    [write puzzlehunts](http://puzzle.berkeley.edu), fiddle with servers, bike,
    play board games, and enjoy eating delicious foods!

One of the reasons that I find Sandstorm so compelling is that I care deeply
about security and privacy, but also about making delightful user experiences.
These goals are frequently in conflict with each other, but
Sandstorm is remarkable in that its design enables us to provide **real**
security -- isolation between orthogonal concerns, sandboxing, protections
against whole classes of attacks -- while also making that security useful and
meaningful to users, by staying out of the way of user workflows, minimizing
cognitive load, and capturing user intent instead of asking tons of questions.

### Meetup on May 7

I'll be at the first [Sandstorm Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/222166097/)
this Thursday, May 7, in San Francisco, so if you're in the area, come visit the
Thoughtworks office at 315 Montgomery from 6pm - 9pm!
I look forward to meeting some new faces!
