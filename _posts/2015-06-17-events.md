David, Jade, and Asheesh will be speaking at events in Portland, OR, and
San Francisco.

### San Francisco meetup, June 18

At our
[second SF meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/223113702/),
we'll have a brief intro by core dev David Renshaw about the new sharing features of Sandstorm.
We're lucky to have
David in town, as he's normally in Pittsburgh.

Co-founder Jade Wang will showcase how to package a Meteor app for Sandstorm, which
is a preview of her jQuerySF talk. 

That'll be at ThoughtWorks (thanks to them for hosting!) in San Francisco, 6 PM
Thu 6/18. [RSVP here!](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/223113702/)

### jQuerySF, June 22-23

At the upcoming [jQuerySF](http://jquerysf.com/) conference, Jade will give
a talk entitled "Sandstorm.io: one-click, deploy anywhere." It's
at 11:10am on Monday, June 22.

### Open Source Bridge, Portland, OR, week of June 22

I'm giving two talks at Open Source Bridge, and would love to see
Sandstorm-minded people there.

* [Five years, 1000 students: The story of Open Source Comes to Campus](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1527), Thu Jun 25, 10am

I hope to see you in SF or Portland! Feel free
to drop me a line; I'm asheesh at sandstorm.io.
