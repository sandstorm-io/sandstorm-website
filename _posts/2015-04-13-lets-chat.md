Last week, I packaged Let's Chat, an open source team chat app, similar to Slack. You can try it on the Sandstorm demo [right now](https://demo.sandstorm.io/appdemo/qkgkaxfqhgsff8zgx2f4nf1a8xvmpte6wa19egmfkk06mzt7e8dh), or install it from the [app list](https://sandstorm.io/apps/).

As described by its developers:

> Let's Chat is a persistent messaging application that runs on Node.js and MongoDB. It's designed to be easily deployable and fits well with small, intimate teams.

A few notes on the packaging process: This package doesn't use the normal MongoDB, but instead [Kenton's fork](https://github.com/kentonv/mongo/tree/niscu). This allows the app to only use ~300KB of storage when each instance is created instead of the normal minimum of a few hundred MB for Mongo. Otherwise, the packaging process went very smoothly except for dealing with passport, a Node.js authentication library. I ended up forking [passport-token](https://github.com/leepowellcouk/passport-token) to look at HTTP headers only (by default it will look at POST data as well, which would make it insecure inside Sandstorm). You can see the forked code [here](https://github.com/jparyani/lets-chat/tree/sandstorm/node_modules/passport-token), and if there's some interest, I can work to get it published on NPM.

You can see the full package source [here](https://github.com/jparyani/lets-chat), and if you want to use [Let's Chat](https://demo.sandstorm.io/appdemo/qkgkaxfqhgsff8zgx2f4nf1a8xvmpte6wa19egmfkk06mzt7e8dh), check it out on the [app list](https://sandstorm.io/apps/). Feel free to let me know what you think on [sandstorm-dev](https://groups.google.com/group/sandstorm-dev).
