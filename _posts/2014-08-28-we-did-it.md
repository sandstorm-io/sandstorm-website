Thanks to you, we've reached our funding goal with four days to spare. We are honored to have been pushed past the goal by renowned Free Software developer [Audrey Tang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang), who among many other things is one of the core developers of [EtherCalc](https://ethercalc.net/), an app which has been [ported to Sandstorm](https://blog.sandstorm.io/news/2014-08-05-ethercalc.html). Audrey becomes our second Key Individual Sponsor. We were also helped immensely by our second Corporate Sponsor, HumanWeb Networks. (A third Corporate Sponsor came in this morning; details coming soon.)

**We are still accepting contributions!** Now through Sunday is your last chance to pick up one of our campaign perks and get yourself listed in our credits. Go grab a t-shirt and a sticker pack (featuring [the Sand Cat](https://blog.sandstorm.io/news/2014-08-27-sandcat.html)), preorder Sandstorm hosting, or grab one of the four remaining LAN Party Invites, or become one of our key sponsors.

### One More App: MediaWiki

We've just released our last app port of the campaign: MediaWiki. This is the very software that powers Wikipedia, packaged as a Sandstorm app. You can use MediaWiki on Sandstorm to host a private wiki for you and your friends or teammates. Go install it from the app list now, either on your own Sandstorm server or on [our demo](https://demo.sandstorm.io).
