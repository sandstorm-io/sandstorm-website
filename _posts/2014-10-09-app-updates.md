It's been a while since our last post, but we've been doing a ton of stuff. It's been a mad scramble here at Sandstorm HQ to get things organized after our [successful crowdfunding campaign](http://igg.me/at/sandstorm). Let me fill you in on some of the things we've been doing!

### App Updates

The Sandstorm app list now stands at 20 apps. While we will continue adding more, it's also important to keep the ones we have up to date. To that end, today we've pushed updates to several apps which have seen upstream changes since our original releases:

* Ghost
* Wave
* Mediagoblin
* Tiny Tiny RSS
* EtherCalc

We have more updates coming soon, including Mailpile, Groovebasin, and ShareLaTeX.

We are also excited to say that our EtherCalc port will henceforth be directly maintained by the upstream maintainer, Audrey Tang.

We don't have automatic "push" updates yet (they're coming), so to update your copy of a Sandstorm app, you must go to the [app list](https://sandstorm.io/apps) and install it again. Sandstorm will recognize that you're installing an update and will upgrade your existing files.

### Meeting Notes

Curious to see what's going on with Sandstorm on a day-to-day basis? We have started posting our daily meeting notes to the [Sandstorm dev list](https://groups.google.com/group/sandstorm-dev). Feel free to subscribe for updates. (And yes, we do hope to move the mailing list to a Sandstorm app as soon as we have one. ;) )

### App Committee

The App Committee will begin voting on new Sandstorm Apps soon. You can follow the action on the [App Committee group](groups.google.com/group/sandstorm-app-committee) (but only committee members can post there).

### APIs

Sandstorm recently gained the ability to host apps which expose APIs. This means that it's now possible to do things like have a mobile client app which talks to your Sandstorm server. We will soon be updating some of our existing apps to take advantage of this feature, at which point we'll do a larger announcement. Check out the [sandstorm-dev post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sandstorm-dev/7D6R5kDSyRw/jvDP5Br7AgwJ) for details.

### Perk fulfillment

**Credits:** Everyone who contributed and who responded to our questionnaire is now named in the [Sandstorm about page](https://demo.sandstorm.io/about) and on [our home page](https://sandstorm.io). If you contributed but missed the questionnaire we sent out, please [e-mail us](mailto:support@sandstorm.io) to let us know how you want your name to appear.

**Stickers and t-shirts:** We've collected everyone's shipping addresses and t-shirt sizes and will be shipping these out soon. It took a little longer than expected to get everyone to respond, but we've now passed the info off to the fulfillment company and expect these to ship within the next five weeks or so.
