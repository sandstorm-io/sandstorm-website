Last Thursday, [Jack Singleton](https://github.com/jacksingleton) published a
totally new app, designed for Sandstorm:
[Hacker Slides](https://github.com/jacksingleton/hacker-slides).

He explains:

<blockquote style="width: auto;"><p>You can write markdown on the left, and
preview your presentation on the right.</p></blockquote>

Here is what it looks like. Click the image to try it on the Sandstorm demo:

</a>

Hacker Slides relies on the Sandstorm APIs, which means Jack never had to write
code to handle user login, access control, or handling multiple documents.

He's generously made it open source and published it on the
[Sandstorm App List](https://sandstorm.io/apps/), so you can install it with one
click on your self-hosted Sandstorm instance.
