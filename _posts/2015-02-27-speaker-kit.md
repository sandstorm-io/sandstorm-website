Have you been wanting to give a Sandstorm lightning talk, but haven't found time
to put together slides? To make that easier, I made a
[speaker kit](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Speaker-Kit-Lightning-Talk)!

It has slides, notes, and advice so you can give a talk that explains the "what"
and "why" of Sandstorm, and for showcasing an app of your choice on the
[Sandstorm Demo](https://demo.sandstorm.io/).

### Where should I give my talk?

Anywhere there's a local software meetup, or Linux users group, or tech group
within your company or university, there are people who want to learn about
Sandstorm.

For a programming meetup, attendees would be especially interested if you demo
Sandstorm with an app on their platform. For a Node meetup, think EtherCalc.
For Python (or data scientists!), think IPython Notebook. For Ruby, GitLab.
For Rust, Acronymy. For Meteor, Telescope. (Check out the
[Sandstorm app list](https://sandstorm.io/apps/) if you need more ideas!)

If you work with physicists or mathematicians, show them ShareLaTeX.

If you attend a tech conference, a Linux users group or other open
source-oriented meetup, they'll
be captivated by the _why_ and _what_ of Sandstorm: easy web app self-hosting,
with no config files or environment variables.

### Get in touch

The [speaker kit](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Speaker-Kit-Lightning-Talk)
will get you started, and if you want practice, or coaching, or
help promoting your talk, I'd love to hear from you.
I also want to send you
stickers! Write me an email at
[community@sandstorm.io](mailto:community@sandstorm.io)!

And thanks to all the people who worked on the
["Intro to Meteor" Speaker Kit](https://meteor.hackpad.com/Intro-to-Meteor-speaker-kit-uaPe3zDDH8z)
-- Alice Yu, Cesar Chen, Miroslav Hibler, Robert Dickert, and others -- for
writing a clear, inviting document that inspired me.
