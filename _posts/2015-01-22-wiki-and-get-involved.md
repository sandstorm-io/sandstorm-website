The [Sandstorm wiki](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki) is now
world-writable, and I made a new page to help people
[get involved](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Get-Involved).

I realized the wiki should be world-writable when
[phildini](http://www.philipjohnjames.com/) remarked on IRC that the
[porting guide](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Porting-Guide)
could give better advice for Mac OS users. What I really wanted to do was ask
him to update the page himself, but I discovered I would first need to grant him
access. So I made it writable by anyone logged into GitHub, and I configured a
[script](https://github.com/paulproteus/github-wiki-diffs) to email a
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-auto-wiki)
whenever it gets changed. Within forty-eight hours, I saw a new person
contribute to the wiki!

The wiki is one of the things I mention on the new
[Get Involved](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Get-Involved) page.
In writing it, I took a lot of inspiration from [Meteor's](https://www.meteor.com/get-involved)
-- it's a
[particularly great one](https://twitter.com/asheeshlaroia/status/555747565493563392).
My goals are to showcase all the ways to contribute to Sandstorm across diverse
skill sets and to have a contextualized listing of all the places that project
members communicate. I'm excited to watch the community build great things on
Sandstorm, and extraordinarily grateful to people who share the platform with
friends. I think the most important thing Sandstorm needs right now is more
people knowing about the project.

So please give it a read and
[get involved](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Get-Involved)!
