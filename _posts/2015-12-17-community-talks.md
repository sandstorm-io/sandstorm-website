I made this list based on [the page on the wiki](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Sandstorm-Talks). If you also gave a talk about Sandstorm this year and are just now adding yourself to the wiki, drop me a line at [community@sandstorm.io](mailto:community@sandstorm.io), and I'll update the post to include you. A huge thanks to everyone who has given a talk, as well as the folks in the brigade who show up everywhere on Hacker News, reddit, and request coverage of Sandstorm on the [Linux Action Show](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/90881/thankfully-its-open-source-las-393/). I heart all of you. If any of you happen to live in or travel through the SF Bay Area, you should share your work at a [Sandstorm meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/) or at least drop by.

Here are some ways to get involved in the community:

* Start a [local Sandstorm meetup](https://sandstorm.meetup.com) and spread the love: drop a line to [community@sandstorm.io](mailto:community@sandstorm.io) and let me know where you are.

* Give a Sandstorm talk at a local meetup or hackerspace or your work place: check out [this speaker kit](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Speaker-Kit-Lightning-Talk), and add your talk to [the list](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Sandstorm-Talks).

* Subscribe to the shiny new [Sandstorm YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8xKZRW86Fa9W00uAppBXXg)

Stay tuned for App Market highlights of 2015!
