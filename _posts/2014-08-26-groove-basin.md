Today we are releasing our port of [Groove Basin](http://groovebasin.com/), the ongoing product of [Andrew Kelley](http://andrewkelley.me/)'s three year quest to [build the ultimate music player](http://andrewkelley.me/post/quest-build-ultimate-music-player.html).

With the Groove Basin app, you can upload music to a Sandstorm grain and listen to it from anywhere. Groove Basin provides loudness compensation, gapless playback, and support for a wide range of codecs, including all of the common ones like mp3, flac, ogg, m4a, aif, wav, and wma.

As befits a Sandstorm app, Groove Basin also has some interesting sharing features. You can connect one client to speakers and let other clients act as remote controls, with the ability to control playback and upload new music. Alternatively, you can set up a long distance listening party, where geographically dispersed listeners share a playback stream. We've integrated Groove Basin's permissions system with Sandstorm's, so only the instance owner is allowed to perform destructive actions like deleting tracks or editing tags.

I highly recommend that you give it a spin, either on your personal Sandstorm server or on the [demo](https://demo.sandstorm.io).
