Today we're releasing a major new app on Sandstorm: Ghost.

[Ghost](http://ghost.org) is a blogging platform featuring beautiful design, and which was funded by [its own crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform) last year. We're extremely excited to bring it into the Sandstorm fold, in particular because we've been wanting to use it ourselves!

You can use Ghost on Sandstorm to publish a blog to an arbitrary domain. It uses Sandstorm's [web publishing features](/news/2014-06-04-self-service-web-publishing.html).

If you have a Sandstorm server, go install Ghost from the app list now. Don't have one? [Try our demo server.](https://demo.sandstorm.io/demo)
