One positive side effect of my work on the
[GitLab app](2015-01-21-gitweb-and-gitlab.html) is that we now have a
[porting guide](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Ruby-on-Rails)
tailored specifically for [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).
If you have a Rails app that you'd like to package for Sandstorm, this is
the place to start. The guide should quickly get you up and running, and it
explains how to deal with a few quirks that are particular to how Rails and
Sandstorm interact.

I invite you to
[read it](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Ruby-on-Rails), to try
porting an app, and to tell me what you think! I am by no means an expert on
anything Ruby-related, so don't hesitate to contribute corrections, either by
directly editing the wiki, by starting a discussion on the
[sandstorm-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev)
mailing list, or by [emailing me](mailto:david@sandstorm.io).
