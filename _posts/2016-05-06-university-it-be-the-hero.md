Picture yourself running a university IT helpdesk. When professors come to you, you point to the
tech tools your colleagues have already deployed. It takes a long process to get something new
approved. You know that's been limiting professors' creativity, but you haven't known what to do
about it.

Then one day, Sandstorm comes along.

Now educators are empowered to help themselves. They can make course websites with Ghost, teach
students how to typeset documents using ShareLaTeX, or create shared folders for classes using
Davros. They can even use GrooveBasin to set up a collaborative radio station for a music history
course.

All that happens on your Sandstorm server, running safely within the institution.

### Can you help spread the word?

Néna Nguyễn just finished designing a page with the
[information educators need about Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/go/education). I'm writing because
I need your help reaching educators and technologists to share it with.

Can you think of an IT staffer or professor who is wondering how to get access to a wider variety of
software available at their institution? If so, please send them a link to
[https://sandstorm.io/go/education](https://sandstorm.io/go/education). I just sent it to the head
of IT at my alma mater's CS department.

If they ask you about security or privacy, you can tell them that Sandstorm is
[self-hostable](https://sandstorm.io/install/) open source software, integrates with
[LDAP/SAML single sign-on](https://sandstorm.io/business), and
[automatically mitigates 95% of security issues, before they are even discovered](https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-02-29-security-track-record).
For more on Sandstorm's security design, read our
[security practices documentation](https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-practices/).

Thanks!
