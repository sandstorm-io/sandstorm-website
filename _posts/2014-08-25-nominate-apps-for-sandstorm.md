What app would YOU like to see on Sandstorm? 

We'd love to hear from you. From now until the end of the campaign, you can tweet in your favorite apps to our app survey. Just nominate them with a tweet, and they'll make the short-list for the App Committee to consider. For instance: "I'd love to see @joindiaspora on @SandstormIO! http://igg.me/at/sandstorm"

The apps will be presented in a list to the App Committee with the number of votes (tweets) it received, starting with the most highly requested. The App Committee will then decide what makes sense to work on first.

How it works:
* If the app has a twitter handle, please use it (or include a link to the app, if they don't).
* You can tweet multiple apps, and ask your friends for retweets.
* Retweets count as votes.
* For your vote to be counted, your tweet should begin with a character other than @ and contain @SandstormIO and a link to the [Indiegogo campaign](http://igg.me/at/sandstorm).
* Hint: Use the "tweet" button on the campaign page to get your personalized referral link so that you can receive [referral bonuses](/news/2014-08-22-campaign-recap.html#referral_program).

We're in the home stretch, 83% of our way there, with just one more week left in the campaign! We need your help to make Sandstorm happen.

P.S. Of course, you can always port the app yourself rather than wait for us. Please drop us a line if you do. :)
