I was recently traveling to Boston for the
[MIT Mystery Hunt](http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/) and to Chicago
to see my
[favorite band's last show](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/chicago/2015/01/rainer_maria_pl.html).
While in town, I thought it'd be nice to
meet up with Sandstorm fans. Here's us!

In Boston, at [Clover Food Lab](http://www.yelp.com/biz/clover-cambridge-5):

If I'm traveling again, I'll drop a line to
[sandstorm-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev) --
one more good reason to subscribe!
