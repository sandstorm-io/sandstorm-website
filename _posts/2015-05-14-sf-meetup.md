Last Thursday, May 7, I helped organize the first event of the new
[Sandstorm SF Bay Area meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/).
The event was a Project Night, modeled after
the
[Boston Python Project Nights](http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/221084961/)
that Jessica McKellar, Ned Batchelder, and I helped start a few years ago.

> Project nights are **unstructured chances for Sandstorm developers & users to work together**, mentor each other, connect socially, teach, learn, **or do whatever else** it is Sandstorm users & developers want to do together.

I started with a brief introduction to Sandstorm, to ensure new people had
some context.

After that, we laptopped and chatted. Here are some highlights from
