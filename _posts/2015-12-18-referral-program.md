The easiest way to enjoy Sandstorm is on our [managed hosting](https://oasis.sandstorm.io/).
Now, when you invite your friends to the service, you'll get up to 30 GB
of bonus storage as our way of saying thanks. When you share a grain with a
friend, and they make an account and start sharing, that's a referral.

### How it works

**You share a grain** with a friend (who isn't already an Oasis user).

Friend **signs in.**

**Friend shares a grain** with any person (including you), who successfully opens the grain.

### Keeping track of your bonus

To see how you're progressing, check out the referral program page in the
top-right drop-down menu.

Or you can visit the <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/referrals">referrals program page</a>
directly. Honestly, you should do that right now just to see
[Néna Nguyễn's](https://github.com/neynah) design work.

Paid subscribers can get up to 30 GB of free storage, in addition to the storage
from their account level, 2 GB per person they refer. Free account holders can
unlock unlimited grains and 50 MB of free storage per person they refer, up to 2 GB
total. If you need even more space, you can always upgrade your account.

### Common question: I received referral bonus storage for someone I don't know. How does that happen?

Anyone who signs up for an Oasis account after opening up a grain that you shared
counts as your referral. If you tweeted a link or shared a document on a mailing
list (e.g., puzzle hunt team, collaborators at work, study group), anyone who
found Oasis through you and signs up for an account counts as your referral.
