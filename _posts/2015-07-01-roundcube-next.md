Last week we asked the Sandstorm.io community to come together to support the [Indiegogo campaign of Roundcube Next](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/roundcube-next--2) using their Sandstorm app store credit. Today we're happy to announce that we've raised:

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%; text-align: center;">$10,644</p>

We've contributed the total to Roundcube Next as a lump sum, making the Sandstorm community the single largest contributor!

Roundcube is an open source email app that you can run on Sandstorm today ([demo](https://demo.sandstorm.io/appdemo/0qhha1v9ne1p42s5jw7r6qq6rt5tcx80zpg1f5ptsg7ryr4hws1h)). They are running a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to modernize their user interface and bring Roundcube to mobile. Although [the campaign has reached its funding goal](http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/24/massive-open-source-email-collaboration-platform-roundcube-beats-indiegogo-funding-goal/), they've got some great stretch goals and you can still contribute until it ends tomorrow.

Almost a year ago, [Sandstorm raised approximately $60K on Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sandstorm-io-personal-cloud-platform) to fundamentally change the way we use and host web applications. When we raised our $1.3M seed round last January, we [made a promise](/news/2015-01-15-sandstorm-1.3M-seed-round-pay-it-forward.html) to the community to pay-it-forward -- to forward the crowdfunds to support other open source projects (such as Roundcube) in the ecosystem through the App Market. Since the Roundcube Next crowdfunding campaign launched before the App Market launched, we rallied the original Sandstorm contributors to dedicate a portion of their App Market credit to forward to Roundcube Next as a bloc.

Roundcube [has promised](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107599969974415778560/+AaronSeigo/posts/B1Vnkq5MNmo) that they will directly support Sandstorm as a target platform for Roundcube Next, meaning the app will get timely updates and integrate with Sandstorm-specific features. For example, we want to make it easy to attach Sandstorm documents to email for sharing.

Let's take a moment to thank all the Sandstorm contributors who have chosen to forward part or all of their App Market credit to Roundcube:
