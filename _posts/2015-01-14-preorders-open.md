I'm excited to announce that starting today, pre-orders for Sandstorm managed hosting are now open. 

<div style="text-align: center"><a class="big-inline-button" href="https://sandstorm.io/preorder.html">Pre-order Managed Hosting &#187;</a></div>

All pre-order customers will enjoy free access to the beta once it's ready, and beta invites will be distributed first-come-first-serve as capacity ramps up. Backers who pre-ordered Sandstorm hosting on Indiegogo will get beta access first, followed by the new pre-orders. Oh, and I'll also send you [some sand cat stickers](http://www.stickermule.com/user/1070634039/stickers) in thanks!

Of course, you don't need to use our managed hosting. You can always run Sandstorm on your own Linux box, using only [open source code](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm). We provide managed hosting so that those who don't know how to run their own server -- or just don't have the time -- have a way to run Sandstorm.

Whether or not you have any questions or feedback, come hang out with everybody in #sandstorm on freenode IRC!

Missed out on other perks during the Indiegogo campaign? Come get a shirt and some stickers at an upcoming meetup!
