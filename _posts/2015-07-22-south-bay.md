On Thursday, August 6, the
[Sandstorm meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/)
has its first
event in the South Bay.
[RSVP here!](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/223144969/)

[RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/) is graciously offering space and helping
provide food and drink. They'll also be participating by
showing off their open-source database
for the realtime web and how to use it in a Sandstorm app.

RethinkDB is based in Mountain View, which means easy travel if you're based
in Silicon Valley. After this event, I aim to switch monthly between organizing
events in San Francisco and the South Bay.

* Date & time: Thursday, August 6, 6:30-9:30
* Food & drink: provided, with thanks to RethinkDB
* Location: RethinkDB, 156 E Dana St, Mountain View, CA
* Sign up: [On the Meetup.com event](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/223144969/)

One more thing: You should give a **lightning talk**, where
you talk for five minutes about a success story, a challenge or unresolved
issue you've run into, or whatever else about Sandstorm strikes your fancy.
It'll be easy, and we're a friendly bunch.
