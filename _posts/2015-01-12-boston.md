I'll be in the Boston area next week, and I'll be organizing a web app
self-hosting meet-up on Tuesday, Jan 20, from 7:30pm to 9:30pm at
[Clover Harvard Square](http://www.yelp.com/biz/clover-cambridge-5).
If you're in town, I hope you can escape the cold and come by! First beverage
(beer/hibiscus lemonade/iced coffee/etc.) is on us. Please
[RSVP for free here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/self-hosted-servers-sandstorm-chat-tickets-15273451304)!

If you've read this far, you might appreciate the following personal note:

I used to live in the Boston area, so it'll be nice to see old friends and meet
new people as well. If you haven't heard of Sandstorm, but you care about
personal servers or self-hosting, then I'd love to meet you.

In 2009, I once knew that the authors of a web application I used a lot, and had
complicated feelings about, were coming to town. I read an announcement just
like this one, and I thought, "Whatever, those people are too fancy to want to
talk to me."

I should have gone. And you should come to this one.
