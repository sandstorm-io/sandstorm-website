I'm so happy to see Sandstorm be a part of the _This Week In Tech_ podcast!

In the July 26 episode, "A Surplus Of Bobbleheads," Leo Laporte
mentions he's setting up a home server using Sandstorm. You can [jump
straight to 1:56:41](https://youtu.be/cHgh0_JQ7Qg?t=7001), where he
shows off the Sandstorm app market and talks about how Sandstorm helps him
retain more privacy online. Brian Johnson picked up the link for his
own [7 Minute
Security](https://7ms.us/7ms-221-news-and-links-roundup/) podcast,
citing This Week in Tech for the tip.

If you run a podcast or want to write about Sandstorm, I'm happy to
connect you with great people to interview (perhaps including
me). Send me an email at
