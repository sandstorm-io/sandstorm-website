Last week [we announced the launch of our new web site](/news/2016-01-11-website). Everything has changed!

Today, I want to call your attention to one page that I'm particularly excited to have written: [The "How it works" page](/how-it-works). Sandstorm is radically different from all other web infrastructure you might be familiar with, in that we containerize not just "microservices" but individual documents. As it turns out, this has all kinds of huge advantages, especially in terms of security but also in the ability to compose apps into larger workflows. Read all about it here:
