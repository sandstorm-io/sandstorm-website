I'm hoping to see you in Montreal at
[PyCon 2015](https://us.pycon.org/2015/)! I'm co-speaking at a talk and
a tutorial. I'll also be
eager to talk to people about Sandstorm and self-hosting servers.

Last year, I co-gave a talk about
[turning your computer into a server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqEJxZzbdVM)
with Karen Rustad.
Here's
what it looked like when one of my friends surprised me by changing the
data we were showing during a live demo:

That _Lol_ is supposed to say _Django_. Thanks,
[Luke](https://luke.wf/). Check out my expression of amusement masking horror.

I got compromised because the Django
sample app I demo'd has a default admin account bundled with it, as part of the
demo. The good news is if you're using Sandstorm, the platform
handles authentication & authorization for apps, so this sort of thing won't
happen to you. Plus, as you would expect, Sandstorm ships with no default
passwords.

This year I'm co-leading a tutorial called
[Getting Comfortable With Web Security](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/306/)
where we discuss all sorts of common security issues with web applications;
Jacky Chang and Nicole Zuckerman are my co-presenters. I'm
also sharing a stage with Philip James to answer the question,
[Type python, press enter. What happens?](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/340/)

I hope to see you there! Doubly so if you're interested
in a Sandstorm & server self-hosting Birds of a Feather session.
