Allow me to introduce Sandstorm's new mascot, the Sand Cat. Based on the [adorable desert animal](https://www.google.com/search?q=sand+cat&tbm=isch) who can go for weeks without drinking by using only the water from its prey, the Sand Cat is the handiwork of talented illustrator [N&eacute;na Nguyen](http://nenanguyen.ca/).

The Sand Cat's story will begin to unfold over the coming weeks, but we wanted to give you a sneak peek so that we could let you know that we'll be adding Sand Cat stickers to every sticker pack sold as part of [our Indiegogo campaign](http://igg.me/at/sandstorm). So, if you haven't had a chance yet, grab [a sticker pack for $8](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sandstorm-io-personal-cloud-platform/contributions/new?perk_amt=8&perk_id=2166937) or [a t-shirt plus sticker pack for $32](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sandstorm-io-personal-cloud-platform/contributions/new?perk_amt=32&perk_id=2166959).
