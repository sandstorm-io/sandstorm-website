After visiting Boston (well, Cambridge) for
[LibrePlanet](/news/2015-03-19-libreplanet.html),
I met up with a few Sandstorm fans and prospsective users, and I snapped
some photos.

Three of us met up at
[Clover Kendall](http://www.yelp.com/biz/clover-cambridge-6) to discuss
[NightScout](http://www.nightscout.info/), a free software web app for helping
people share information about their blood sugar levels with family and friends.

Monday evenings are the regular meeting time for
[SIPB](http://sipb.mit.edu), MIT's computing club, and some of us researched if
Sandstorm could be of use to the MIT community.

I hope to see you in my future travels!
