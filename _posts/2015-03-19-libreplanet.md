I'm a Free Software Foundation member, and I'm happy to say that I'll be visiting
Boston this weekend for the FSF's yearly
[LibrePlanet conference](https://www.libreplanet.org/2015/).

You can read more about the conference from
[Zak Rogoff's summary of 2013](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/photos-and-feedback-from-libreplanet)
or
[Shauna Gordon-McKeon's invitation to new speakers in 2014](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/i-spoke-at-libreplanet-and-you-can-too).

If you're in the Boston area between now and Tuesday March 24, send me an email and let's
meet up! I'm asheesh@sandstorm.io.
