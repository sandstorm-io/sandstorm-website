Have you ever wanted to try out new apps for Sandstorm before they make their
way to the app list? Apps always need testing, and you can help.

Historically, the packaging process has been somewhat
opaque -- the App Committee would
[vote](https://sandstorm.io/vote) on apps, and new apps would magically appear
in the [app list](https://sandstorm.io/apps/). If an app's author packages
their own project, it seems to arrive all at once app list.

The truth is, someone tests these apps to make sure
they work properly. App packagers have been emailing people privately to find testers.

I'm opening that testing up to the community with some
new
[documentation](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Testing).

> Anyone who uses Sandstorm can test out new Sandstorm apps and features!
> Consider it our open beta program.

Check out the
[new testing doc](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Testing),
and subscribe to

so you can hear about cool apps that are almost ready!
