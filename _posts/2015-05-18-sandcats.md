title: "Sandcats.io: free dynamic DNS for Sandstorm users"

Sandstorm is open source server software that makes it easy to install web apps
like [Ethercalc](https://ethercalc.org/) or
[Let's Chat](http://sdelements.github.io/lets-chat/). But that's not much use
if your server doesn't have
a name, and setting up DNS correctly for Sandstorm has until now been a complicated,
fiddly process.

That's why today I'm announcing _sandcats.io_, a free dynamic DNS service
for Sandstorm users. It now takes 120 seconds to go from an empty
Linux virtual machine to a working personal server, DNS and all.

The Sandstorm install script asks you what subdomain you want; if you type _alice_, then
your server is online at _alice.sandcats.io_.

It's as simple as that. Check out this 30 second ASCII screencast.

### Solving DNS for Sandstorm users

I say it _solves_ DNS for Sandstorm users because the _sandcats.io_ service
handles all the following complications:

* **Domain provisioning.** You type the name you want for your server while
running the install script.

* **Wildcard DNS.** Sandstorm needs wildcard DNS because, with its security model,
each session of each app runs on a unique unguessable subdomain. This protects against
most cross-site request forgery attacks, for example. Sandcats.io provides wildcard
DNS; this also means that any time a user
runs a new app on your personal Sandstorm server, DNS is already configured.

* **Automatic updates.** Every 60 seconds, your Sandstorm server sends a small
UDP message to the Sandcats.io service. If your IP address has changed, the
service replies with another short message. Upon receipt of that, your server
sends an authenticated message, and _sandcats.io_ updates its records.
Our DNS records have a 60 second
TTL, so if your IP address changes, it will propagate out within two minutes,
and you never had to lift a finger.

* **Domain recovery.** If you lose your authentication keys, you can recover
the domain by typing `help` into the Sandstorm installer.

I'd love to hear your feedback; I'm asheesh@sandstorm.io.

The code is open souce, and you can read more in the
[technical documentation](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Sandcats-dynamic-DNS),
but what I really recommend you do is try it out.

### Switch to your own domain whenever you want

The Sandcats service is optional. If you already have a domain of your own, you
can join the many other people actively running Sandstorm on their own
domain.

If you know you want to go it alone, the install script allows you to opt out
and configure DNS yourself.

Moreover, if you start out with a
_sandcats.io_ sudomain, and you decide you want a little more personality to
your server, you can reconfigure it at any time. Look for your server's
`sandstorm.conf` file.

### Install Sandstorm now to try it out

Sandstorm exists to make it easy to run web apps like Etherpad, HackerSlides,
Let's Chat, and others as easily as you install apps on your phone. If that's
something you want
on a server for you or your organization, I hope you install Sandstorm right now.
