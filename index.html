      <p><strong>Sandstorm protects you.</strong> Each document, chat room, mail box, notebook, blog, or anything else you create is a "grain" in Sandstorm. Sandstorm containerizes each one in its own secure sandbox from which it cannot talk to the world without express permission. All your grains are private until you share them. The result is that 95% of security vulnerabilities are automatically mitigated.

    <section class="auditable">
      <p><strong>Sandstorm makes it easy to adhere to security, regulatory, and data privacy requirements.</strong> Sandstorm manages access control on every document, so it can show who has access and allow you to revoke that access at any time. Self-hosting Sandstorm enables organizations to have complete control over where their data is stored.

No matter where you decide to run Sandstorm, the apps are the same.
    </section>

    <section class="walled-gardens">
      <p><strong>With Sandstorm, you do not get locked into walled gardens.</strong> You can mix and match apps from multiple developers with ease, and even throw in apps of your own as needed. Many Sandstorm apps are open source, which means you can modify them to suit you needs.

    <h3>Businesses</h3>

    <p>Sandstorm lets you keep all your company's data in one place, rather than scattered across dozens of web apps. At the same time, it lets each team in your company choose their own tools and deploy applications to meet their needs, without having to file tickets and wait for support from other teams. This makes your employees more productive while keeping your data safe and under control.
