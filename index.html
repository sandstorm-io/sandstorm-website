      <p>Sandstorm keeps a list so you can find everything you create. Sandstorm's unified access control system covers data from every app, and everything is private to you by default.

    <section class="buggy-apps">
      <p><strong>Sandstorm protects you.</strong> Each document, chat room, mail box, notebook, blog, or anything else that any user creates is a "grain" in Sandstorm. Sandstorm containerizes each one in its own secure sandbox from which it cannot talk to the world without express permission. All your grains are private until the owner shares them. The result is that 95% of security vulnerabilities are automatically mitigated.

    <section class="auditable">
      <p><strong>Sandstorm makes it easy to adhere to security, regulatory, and data privacy requirements.</strong> Sandstorm manages access control on every document, so it can show who has access and allow you to revoke that access at any time. Organizations love self-hosting Sandstorm so they know exactly where the data is stored.

    <section class="hosting">
      <p><strong>You choose where your data lives:</strong> You can use Sandstorm in the cloud on a variety of hosting services, or you can <a href="/get#self-hosting">install it on your own machines.</a> You can even even move between these options at any time. No matter where you decide to run Sandstorm, the apps are the same.
    </section>

    <section class="walled-gardens">
      <p><strong>With Sandstorm, you do not get locked into walled gardens.</strong> You can mix and match apps from multiple developers with ease, and even throw in apps of your own as needed. Many Sandstorm apps are open source, which means you can modify them to suit you needs.
