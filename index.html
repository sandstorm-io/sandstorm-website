  <h2>How is it different?</h2>

  <section class="usability">
    <header>
      <div>
        <h3>Usability <span class="subheading">| Designed for Humans</span></h3>
        <p>Sandstorm is the easiest way there has ever been to run a server.
      </div>
    </header>

    <section class="apps">
      <p><strong>Sandstorm requires no technical expertise to use.</strong>
      <p>Installing apps on Sandstorm is as easy as installing apps on your phone. No need to read documentation and edit config files -- and no need to wait for IT to do it for you.
    </section>

    <section class="grains">
      <p><strong>Sandstorm emphasizes users over apps.</strong>
      <p>You log into Sandstorm, not into each app separately.
      <p>All of your data across all apps (documents, chat rooms, whatever) can be found and searched in one place, rather than logging into each one separately.
      <p>You can share and collaborate on anything -- or keep it private.
    </section>

  <section class="security">
    <header>
      <div>
        <h3>Security <span class="subheading">| Secure by Default</span></h3>
        <p>Sandstorm is ridiculously secure.
      </div>
    </header>

    <section class="buggy-apps">
      <p><strong>The biggest challenge to securing any server is buggy apps.</strong> Some app developers are good at security, but some are not, and it's usually impossible to know who is whom without doing a costly security audit.

      <p>Sandstorm, therefore, takes a different approach: break data down into "grains" (for example, individual documents, or chat rooms) and isolate each one in a secure sandbox from which it cannot talk to the world without your express permission. With this approach, no matter how buggy your document editor might be, each document can only possibly be accessed by the people you shared it with. No matter how buggy your chat room, only the people you permitted will ever see the logs.

      <p>Skeptical? Check out <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/security-practices/">our security docs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Security-non-issues">list of security non-events</a> to learn more.
    </section>

    <section class="auditable">
      <p><strong>Because Sandstorm manages access control on every document,</strong> it can tell you who has accessed your data and allow you to revoke that access at any time. Prove that your sensitive data is secure by reviewing all the systems it is connected to.

  <section class="freedom">
    <header>
      <div>
        <h3>Freedom <span class="subheading">| You're in Control</span></h3>
        <p>Sandstorm gives you choice.
      </div>
    </header>

    <section class="hosting">
      <p><strong>You choose where your data lives:</strong> You can use Sandstorm in the cloud on a variety of hosting services, or you can install it on your own machines. You can even even move between these options at any time. No matter where you decide to run Sandstorm, the apps are the same.
    </section>

    <section class="walled-gardens">
      <p><strong>With Sandstorm, you do not get locked into walled gardens.</strong> You can mix and match apps from multiple developers with ease, and even throw in apps of your own as needed. Many Sandstorm apps are open source, which means you can modify them to suit you needs.
