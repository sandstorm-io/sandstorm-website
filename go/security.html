  <h2>Why use Sandstorm?</h2>
  <h3>Your employees deserve flexible online collaboration tools. You deserve the peace of mind that comes from owning your data. Apps installed on Sandstorm are secure by design.</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li class="why-onprem">
      <h3><strong>On-prem deployment</strong></h3><p><strong>Run Sandstorm on hardware that you control.</strong>  When you put your data in an app's "cloud," you are trusting other companies with your security. Some have great security teams, but some don't, and it's hard to tell from the outside. Sandstorm lets you keep your data in-house, behind your firewall, where you are in control — but without the usual hassle of maintaining your own infrastructure.

    <li class="why-finegrained">
      <h3>Fine-grained isolation</h3><p><strong>Sandstorm isolates every document in its own secure container</strong>. That means that most security bugs in apps don't matter, because only people who already had access to a document can attack it. Serious security bugs are mitigated when an app runs on Sandstorm. To date, Sandstorm's approach wholly or partially mitigated <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-non-events/">95% of publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities</a> we've examined in apps that run on it — and countless bugs that haven't been discovered yet.</p>

  <h2>Keep your corporate network under control</h2>
  <h3>In 2013, <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/">Target was hacked</a> when someone exposed an internal project management app to an external contractor. It cost them a billion dollars.</h3>

  <p>If you have technical staff, then your internal network is probably full of little services that
    they have set up. Build bots. Code review tools. Paste bins. Monitoring. Chat rooms. Project
    management. Git repos. Automations. Maybe someone even set up an app to rate cafeteria food.</p>

  <p><strong>This is a security liability.</strong> If the only thing standing between your
    internal apps and the world is your corporate firewall, then one hole in that firewall is all
    it takes for hackers to get in and spread across the network.</p>

  <p><strong>Sandstorm protects you.</strong> Fine-grained isolation
    neutralizes security bugs in apps and prevents attacks from spreading. Plus, IT can audit
    everything that is running and can see which apps are talking to which others.</p>

  <p><strong>Sandstorm also saves time.</strong> On a typical corp network today, an engineer or
    sys admin may spend hours deploying each app, or weeks waiting for IT to do it for them. On
    Sandstorm, it takes one click, and there's no need for IT to review each deployment, because
    Sandstorm gives IT the tools to stay in control. Plus, developing for Sandstorm is actually
    less work for developers, because Sandstorm handles the boilerplate of authentication, access
    control, and more.</p>
