  <h2>Here's why IT teams love it</h2>
    <h3>With a few clicks IT can pre-install any selection of apps from the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io">App Market</a>. Students and faculty can use any of these apps safely within Sandstorm.</h3>
  <ul>
    
    <li>
      <h3>On-prem install for education privacy</h3>
      <p>Run Sandstorm on hardware that you control. Everything users do on a Sandstorm server stays safely within your institution. Enjoy free dynamic DNS and SSL.</p>
      
    <li>
      <h3>Self-service software</h3>
      <p>Sandstorm provides simple web access to every user at your institution. When you approve Sandstorm, users can use any app safely within Sandstorm, and will file fewer support tickets.</p>

    <li>
      <h3>Single-sign-on and web access</h3>
      <p>Once you enable login via Google, GitHub, email, LDAP, or SAML every app automatically uses that login provider.</p>
    
    <li>
      <h3>Custom apps can use the built-in access control</h3>
      <p>Academic departments need custom apps. As those apps get older, Sandstorm helps you sleep well at night. Sandstorm automatically protects against <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-non-events/">95% of app security issues, according to our analysis.</a></p>
      
    <li>
      <h3>Access control like Google Docs</h3>
      <p>Sandstorm makes all data private by default. Users can share access through a familiar interface.</p>
      
    <li>
      <h3>Automatic app downscaling</h3>
      <p>When a user closes a browser tab to an app, Sandstorm waits a few minutes, then terminates the processes. When the user visits the app again, Sandstorm starts it automatically.</p>
      
    <li>
      <h3>Centralized backups and data migration</h3>
      <p>Your Sandstorm server stores all data for all apps and all the databases they use. When you take a backup of it, you have everything. </p>
      
    <li>
      <h3>Open source software</h3>
      <p>Sandstorm is open source software enjoyed by thousands of individuals at non-profits and companies every day. With <a href="https://sandstorm.io/business">Sandstorm for Work</a> organizations can enjoy LDAP and SAML log in, organization management, and more.</p>
