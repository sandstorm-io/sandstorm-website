  <h2>Developer Features</h2>
  <h3>Ship your code as a Sandstorm app package and your users run the service.</h3>
  <ul id="dev">

    <li class="linux">
      <h3><strong>Any Linux stack</strong></h3>
      <p>Sandstorm apps can be written using any tech stack that runs on Linux. Sandstorm apps have been written in PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Java, Go, C++, Rust, and more.</p>
    <li class="runtime">
      <h3><strong>Consistent runtime environment</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>You don’t have to support a diverse set of operating systems.</strong>
      <p>If your app works on your local development server, it will work on any Sandstorm server anywhere. Sandstorm packaging tools distribute your dependencies with your app.
    <li class="boilerplate">
      <h3><strong>Avoid Boilerplate</strong></h3>
      <p>Common app responsibilities like authentication, authorization, document management, scaling, backups, encryption, and more are handled automatically by the platform.
      <p><strong>You don't have to deal with user management</strong>
      <p>Sandstorm authenticates the user before the request even reach your server.
      <p><strong>You don’t have to deal with sharing or access control</strong>
      <p>Just define the permissions that apply to your app, and Sandstorm will annotate every request with permissions possessed by the user.

    <li class="dev-ops">
      <h3><strong>Dev not ops</strong></h3>
      <p>Spend your time adding features, not fighting fires.
      <p><strong>You don't have to run servers</strong>
      <p>No carrying a pager. No worrying about securing user data. Just upload your spk to the App Market.
      <p><strong>You don’t have to worry about backups or encryption</strong>
      <p>Sandstorm does that for you.
      <p><strong>You don't have to worry about scaling</strong>
      <p>Since each instance of your app handles a single document, it need only run on a single machine, and Sandstorm will deal with orchestrating multiple instances.
      <p><strong>You don’t have to support multiple “documents”</strong>
      <p>Sandstorm will start a new instance of your app for each one.
    <li class="integration">
      <h3><strong>Enterprise integration</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>You don’t have to implement “enterprise” features like audit logging, encryption, LDAP integration, or compliance</strong>
      <p>Sandstorm takes care of that for you.
    <li class="in-app">
      <h3><strong>In-app Billing</strong></h3>
      <p>[coming soon] <strong>You don't have to deal with payments</strong>
      <p>Sandstorm implements in-app purchases and deposits the proceeds into your bank account.
  </ul>
