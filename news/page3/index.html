  <h2><a href="/news/2016-05-31-whats-new">May changelog - what's new in Sandstorm</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-05-31-whats-new">31 May 2016</a>
  
  
  
  
  <p>This month features a big change: when you delete grains, they are sent to a “Trash” area, where
they are held for 30 days before being deleted permanently. I personally have clicked “Delete” on
the wrong grain by accident, so I’m very happy with the new feature! This way, I can undo it.</p>

<p>Self-hosters will also appreciate the totally-redesigned admin interface. Visit /admin on your server
and you’ll see that it’s easier to navigate and visually cleaner.</p>

<p>Here’s the full changelog. As always, you can visit your Sandstorm server and find the changelog
under the “About Sandstorm” section.</p>

<h3 id="v0164-2016-05-20">v0.164 (2016-05-20)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Self-hosting: The admin settings UI has been completely revamped.</li>
  <li>Fixed grain debug log auto-scrolling.</li>
  <li>Sandcats: Fixed obscure ASN.1 type issue in CSRs that was causing Globalsign API to complain.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where logging in via Google or Github while viewing a sharing link which you had already redeemed previously would lead to an error.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0163-2016-05-15-bugfixes">v0.163 (2016-05-15) [bugfixes]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed subtle bug introduced in 0.162 which caused shared grains to refresh every minute.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0162-2016-05-14">v0.162 (2016-05-14)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented “trash”. Deleted grains go to the trash where they can be recovered for up to 30 days.</li>
  <li>Grains can now be deleted from the grain list, without opening them first. Multiple grains can be selected for deletion at once.</li>
  <li>An app can now request that the “who has access” dialog be displayed.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where after an upload failed, future uploads would show the same error despite not having failed.</li>
  <li>Tweaked the “logout other sessions” button to give better feedback that the request is in-progress.</li>
  <li>When visiting a Sandstorm server that hasn’t been set up yet, you’ll now be redirected to the setup wizard.</li>
  <li>The API endpoint now allows the authorization token to be specified as part of the path, for cases where setting the <code>Authorization</code> header is not possible (especially cross-origin WebSocket).</li>
</ul>

  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/jadeqwang">Jade Wang</a>

  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jason_nstar">Jason Hernandez</a> is a journalist who often covers sensitive topics like <a href="http://www.nstarpost.com/17518/145186/a/updated-fbi-continues-to-operate-spy-planes-without-warrants-despite-federal-rul">mass</a> <a href="http://nstarpost.com/17486/159855/a/update-2-cellphone-surveillance-used-on-black-lives-matter-protesters-at-fourth">surveillance</a> for the <a href="http://nstarpost.com/">North Star Post</a>. And given the nature of his work, he and his colleagues are justifiably concerned about the information security, not just between journalists and sources, but also drafts and storage of source materials. So, when Jason was visiting the SF Bay Area, he dropped by Sandstorm meetup to talk about the Sandstorm server he set up so he and his colleagues so that they can still enjoy the benefits of web applications, like real-time collaboration, while keeping control over their data.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-05-12-analytics-privacy">How self-hosted analytics preserve user privacy</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-05-12-analytics-privacy">12 May 2016</a>
  
  <p>Filippo Valsorda just published <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/self-host-analytics/">an overview of why to use Piwik for web analytics</a> instead of Google’s product. He reflects on the fact that he saw <strong>18% more pageviews</strong> with Piwik compared to Google Analytics, seemingly because self-hosted analytics get past ad-blocking browser extensions. I want to reflect on the privacy implications of running your own analytics and explain the nuts and bolts of how Piwik runs on Sandstorm.</p>

<p>Here’s what Piwik on Sandstorm looks like.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016-05-12-blog-post-piwik-screenshot.png" alt="piwik screenshot" /></p>

<h3 id="how-a-web-analytics-service-works">How a web analytics service works</h3>

<p>For a website (let’s say example.com) that that embeds Google Analytics’ Javascript tracking code, a web browser like Chrome takes the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Download the HTML content of example.com.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notice a SCRIPT or IMG tag going to Google Analytics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download the Google Analytics tracking code from Google, whose purpose is to  <strong>tell Google Analytics the URL of the page that included it.</strong> One main purpose of web analytics is to see a chart of which pages are popular, so it stands to reason that if Google runs the analytics tool, Google needs to know what page is being viewed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Google has a strong <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">privacy policy</a>, and this information typically falls under the heading of “Information we get from your use of our services,” and I am personally OK with sharing this information with Google Analytics.</p>

<h3 id="some-people-like-staying-private">Some people like staying private</h3>

<p>According to <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-googleanalytics/all/all">W3Techs</a>, more than 50% of all websites use Google Analytics. This has a somewhat surprising result: Google’s analytics service knows about a <em>huge</em> fraction of all web page visits. After all, any central analytics service can see the webpage visits for all the sites using it. They can even see traffic patterns that each individual site operator cannot.</p>

<p>Some web surfers want to keep their surfing information private. They may be OK with the site owner knowing that someone visited, but Google is not the site owner. They may see <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/data_is_a_toxic.html">data as a toxic asset,</a> per Bruce Schneier. Many of them use web browser add-ons like <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger.</a></p>

<p>As a website operator, this puts you in a bind. If you want to use Google Analytics to get a graph of which pages are popular, you need to share your users’ surfing patterns with Google. Google doesn’t distribute Google Analytics as software you can run; they only run it as a central service.</p>

<p>A different way to do web analytics is to use software running on a server that you maintain. This is called <strong>self-hosting web analytics.</strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to do that is to do what <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/self-host-analytics">Filippo Valsorda said:</a> run a Sandstorm server and <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/xuajusd5d4a9v4js71ru0cwj9wn984q1x8kny10htsp8f5dcfep0">install Piwik from the app market,</a> and copy-paste something into your website.</p>

<p>Today, that’s possible with a few presses on a touchpad. Getting to that point involved some fascinating challenges.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-share-an-api-token-you-cannot-see">How to share an API token you cannot see</h3>

<p>One design goal of Sandstorm is that apps are <strong><a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-practices/#true-confinement">confined.</a></strong> An app in Sandstorm never learns a URL that outsiders can use to reach it. That way, the app must rely on Sandstorm for access control, which means the “Share access” button can always show the users who has access. Sandstorm can provide one interface for granting and revoking access across all apps.</p>

<p>However, Piwik needs a way to show a URL that a website operator can embed into their website, so that website visitors can be tracked by Piwik!</p>

<p>To get past this Catch-22, <a href="https://github.com/zarvox">Drew Fisher</a> built a new Sandstorm feature called <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/http-apis/#creating-an-offer-template">offer templates</a>. Piwik asks Sandstorm to show a templated message, and an IFRAME from Sandstorm appears with that token placed into the templated message. Drew’s Piwik package was the first to use it, and it’s become the most common way for apps on Sandstorm to create copy-pastable instructions for how to connect to their APIs.</p>

<h3 id="when-to-make-ip-addresses-available">When to make IP addresses available</h3>

<p>Another obstacle was IP addresses. Piwik needs to know the IP address of visitors so it can create a visual map to show website operators where in the world their visitors come from.  However, we didn’t want every Sandstorm app to be able to collect this data without user intervention. Drew added a <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/blob/432be37489b210b19d9677f29befcd5c910a0f76/src/sandstorm/api-session.capnp#L28">way for client-side Javascript to optionally share the user’s IP address</a>, while keeping the defaults safe. I’ll quote him here:</p>

<blockquote class="notbig">
Normally, we strip the remote address from requests, since most applications shouldn't need it.  However, for those that benefit from it (like analytics), clients can opt into passing their IP on to the backend by adding an "X-Sandstorm-Passthrough: address" header to their request.  This would be a privacy leak for WebSession, since the grain can give the client scripts which would send the header, but ApiSession requires a user action, so it's safe here.
</blockquote>

<p>In the context of the above, an ApiSession covers requests that come in via an app’s <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/http-apis/">HTTP APIs</a> such as Piwik’s tracking system, and a WebSession covers requests that come in from the grain owner clicking around, such as a site owner viewing their statistics.</p>

<h3 id="enabling-the-community">Enabling the community</h3>

<p>When we finished, we had built a foundation that other apps could build upon. You can try <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/4mfserfc04wtcevvgn0jw27hvwfntmt8j468y3ma55kj8d5tj9kh">Hummingbird,</a> <a href="https://github.com/mnutt">Michael Nutt</a>’s real-time analytics tool, and <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/8kr4rvyrggvzfvc160htzdt4u5rfvjc2dgdn27n5pt66mxa40m1h">Radicale,</a> <a href="https://github.com/synchrone">Aleksandr Bogdanov</a>’s package that enables calendar and contact synchronization by combining a few tools.</p>

<p>If you want to make an open source web app that anyone can self-host safely, start at the <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/">Sandstorm Developer Hub</a>. Sandstorm supports any programming language or stack, like PHP or Meteor or Rust, that runs on Linux. You’ll find a <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/packaging-tutorial/">packaging tutorial</a> and detailed information about offer templates. And if you just want to start using Piwik, <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/xuajusd5d4a9v4js71ru0cwj9wn984q1x8kny10htsp8f5dcfep0">check it out on the app market.</a></p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-05-06-university-it-be-the-hero">Sandstorm lets university IT be the hero</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-05-06-university-it-be-the-hero">06 May 2016</a>
  
  <p>Picture yourself running a university IT helpdesk. When professors come to you, you point to the
tech tools your colleagues have already deployed. It takes a long process to get something new
approved. You know that’s been limiting professors’ creativity, but you haven’t known what to do
about it.</p>

<p>Then one day, Sandstorm comes along.</p>

<p>Now educators are empowered to help themselves. They can make course websites with Ghost, teach
students how to typeset documents using ShareLaTeX, or create shared folders for classes using
Davros. They can even use GrooveBasin to set up a collaborative radio station for a music history
course.</p>

<p>All that happens on your Sandstorm server, running safely within the institution.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-help-spread-the-word">Can you help spread the word?</h3>

<p>Néna Nguyễn just finished designing a page with the
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/go/education">information educators need about Sandstorm</a>. I’m writing because
I need your help reaching educators and technologists to share it with.</p>

<p>Can you think of an IT staffer or professor who is wondering how to get access to a wider variety of
software available at their institution? If so, please send them a link to
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/go/education">https://sandstorm.io/go/education</a>. I just sent it to the head
of IT at my alma mater’s CS department.</p>

<p>If they ask you about security or privacy, you can tell them that Sandstorm is
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/install/">self-hostable</a> open source software, integrates with
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/business">LDAP/SAML single sign-on</a>, and
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-02-29-security-track-record">automatically mitigates 95% of security issues, before they are even discovered</a>.
For more on Sandstorm’s security design, read our
<a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-practices/">security practices documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
