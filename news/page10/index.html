  <h2><a href="/news/2015-11-12-authenticated-app-packages">Authenticated app packages on Sandstorm with PGP and Keybase</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/zarvox">Drew Fisher</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2015-11-12-authenticated-app-packages">12 Nov 2015</a>
  <p>I like to joke that Sandstorm is a security project posing as a
usability project.  In actuality, it’s both!  Sandstorm users deserve to be
confident that the apps they’re running are exactly as
the packager built them, and have not been backdoored or accidentally modified
by a malicious ISP, government, or other attacker.  Furthermore, this
information must be easy to consume and verify.</p>

<p>To that end, I’ve worked with Kenton to make it possible to provide a cryptographic chain of trust
that connects the app package you’re installing to the app publisher’s online
accounts.  When you install the
<a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/a0n6hwm32zjsrzes8gnjg734dh6jwt7x83xdgytspe761pe2asw0">EtherCalc spreadsheet app</a>,
Sandstorm lets you see that the app was made by the same Audrey Tang that owns
<a href="https://github.com/audreyt">audreyt on Github</a> and
<a href="https://keybase.io/au">au on Keybase</a>.
Publisher information is shown front and center:</p>

<p><img src="/news/images/install-ethercalc.png" width="100%" alt="Installing EtherCalc" /></p>

<p>To make this all work, there are a few steps involved.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-id-is-a-public-key">The app ID is a public key</h3>

<p>Sandstorm has required that apps be signed since its inception, providing
a first line of defense against package corruption.  The app is signed with an
app-specific Ed25519 key at package-building time.  Sandstorm uses the public key
as the app’s ID on the app market and your server.</p>

<p>This guarantees that app packages cannot be modified by a CDN or the app market
without using a different app ID.  This also had the nice effect of providing
trust-on-first-use properties for apps until we were able to bind these
identities to something more meaningful.  The upshot: when you’ve installed an
app, only the same app author can provide updates to it.</p>

<h3 id="connect-the-app-id-to-a-pgp-key">Connect the app ID to a PGP key</h3>

<p>Since the release of the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/">app market</a>,
app packagers have been PGP-signing statements that they are the author of the
Sandstorm app with that app ID, and include that statement, their PGP public 
key, and the email address associated with that key in their package’s metadata.
Since that metadata is in the Sandstorm package file signed by the Ed25519 key,
any server running Sandstorm can verify
that these statements were provided by the person or people who control that
Ed25519 key.  Additionally, since the statement is signed by the PGP key, there
is a trust path from the owner of that PGP private key to the app you are
installing. To defeat this, an attacker would need to convince an app author to
replace both their signing statement and their PGP key in the package metadata
with ones produced by the attacker.</p>

<h3 id="connect-the-pgp-key-to-social-identities">Connect the PGP key to social identities</h3>

<p>The next goal is to connect that PGP fingerprint to meaningful, real-world
identities.  While a handful of people might be able to rely on the
web-of-trust to verify PGP fingerprints, most users will need something more
approachable.  That’s where <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> comes in.  Keybase
helps you link PGP keys to social identities, like GitHub or Twitter accounts.
App authors can create a Keybase account, then create signed proofs-of-ownership
that they post to their social media pages or websites.  Keybase provides an
index of these proofs, so given a PGP fingerprint, you can list the accounts for
which the PGP key’s owner has proven control.</p>

<h3 id="the-result-end-to-end-verified-apps">The result: end-to-end verified apps</h3>

<p>When you go to install a package, Sandstorm verifies that the package is
correctly signed by the Ed25519 key.  It looks for a PGP signature in the 
metadata, and verifies that the PGP-signed assertion is for the correct app ID 
and the email address specified in the metadata.  It queries the Keybase API to
see what accounts the packager has proven ownership of, and lists them with 
their links on the app install page.</p>

<p>Currently, the implementation of this feature trusts Keybase’s servers to verify
proofs and return an accurate list of the signer’s identities. However, Keybase
proofs are designed to be verifiable by third parties without trusting Keybase,
and we plan to extend Sandstorm to do this, thus eliminating Keybase itself from
the trust chain.</p>

<p>So that’s how Sandstorm links app packages to their
creators’ social identities, with cryptographic verification at each step along
the way, with no additional action needed by end users.  This is software
authenticity that Just Works, and it’s available today for all Sandstorm users
and packages in the App Market.  Today is a good day to

  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/jadeqwang">Jade Wang</a>

    - <a href="/news/2015-11-10-icons-spks-for-everyone">10 Nov 2015</a>
  <p>Open source web app developers build great apps. But sometimes, backend-minded developers need a little help, from making it easy for end users to install their apps to making their icons and other graphics visually appealing. To make open source web apps <a href="/news/2014-07-21-open-source-web-apps-require-federated-hosting.html">viable</a> as an ecosystem, the apps must be easy to install and use, and to get the attention they deserve, they should have good-looking icons that convey the purpose of the app.</p>

<h3 id="graphics-for-everyone">Graphics for everyone</h3>

<p>Lately, we’ve been running an experiment – will app authors be interested in custom graphics, designed by Néna Nguyen at Sandstorm? So far, <a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc/issues/236">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/cem/dillinger-sandstorm/pull/2">response</a> <a href="https://github.com/cem/nodebb-sandstorm/pull/1">has</a> <a href="https://github.com/jacksingleton/hacker-slides/issues/28">been</a> <a href="https://github.com/strawlab/neuron-catalog/pull/36">positive</a>!</p>

<p>So I’m excited to announce we’ll do this for everyone who packages their app
for Sandstorm: To support app authors, we are happy to help with graphics. This is on top of the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/">one-click install</a> for your app that Sandstorm enables, which works just as well <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io">in the cloud</a> as it does for <a href="https://sandstorm.io/install">self-hosters</a> (see below). For instance, Néna will make an icon for you if you need it. Check out this awesome icon set that Néna made for Wekan (kanban board):</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2015-10-01-free-ssl-certificates">Free, automated SSL certificates for Sandstorm self-hosters</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2015-10-01-free-ssl-certificates">01 Oct 2015</a>
  <p><em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you <a href="https://sandstorm.io/install/">install Sandstorm</a> and choose to use a subdomain of our dynamic DNS service sandcats.io, we’ll automatically set you up with an HTTPS certificate from GlobalSign. The private key never leaves your machine and is automatically rotated every week.</em></p>

<p>People who run their own servers often do it for privacy. Many of them use our open source Sandstorm software to easily run apps like <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/h37dm17aa89yrd8zuqpdn36p6zntumtv08fjpu8a8zrte7q1cn60">document editors</a>, <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/vfnwptfn02ty21w715snyyczw0nqxkv3jvawcah10c6z7hj1hnu0">group chat apps</a>, <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h">task management</a>, and <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io">more</a>.</p>

<p>But a private server is not really private if you’re communicating with it in plaintext. So, starting today, if you <a href="https://sandstorm.io/install/">install Sandstorm</a> on your own Linux server, and you choose to host at a subdomain of our free dynamic DNS service sandcats.io, you will have free, automatically-renewing HTTPS certificates by default. That means you get privacy on the network without any hassle.</p>

<p>For companies and individuals who run their own Sandstorm servers, it’s now easy to secure yourself with HTTPS. Here are the steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download and run the <a href="https://sandstorm.io/install/">Sandstorm install script</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose a subdomain of <code>sandcats.io</code> you want to register (and tell us how to contact you to recover the domain).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visit your server’s new web dashboard by clicking the URL printed out by the install script.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Sandstorm automatically enables HTTPS as part of step 2. There’s no setting up reverse proxies, no creating certificate signing requests, no waiting on a CA. Your private key is on your machine and never leaves.</p>

<h3 id="why-you-need-https">Why you need HTTPS</h3>

<p>HTTPS (also commonly but incorrectly called “SSL”) is important because the web’s original protocol, HTTP, is insecure – anyone in a coffee shop near you can see what you’re browsing or modify your traffic. This is a real threat; here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my4oZqBU5zE">video of someone stealing HTTP traffic</a> that was made as a school project.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, web companies like <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/making-search-more-secure.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/secure-browsing-by-default/10151590414803920">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/securing-your-twitter-experience-with-https">Twitter</a> have been switching their sites to require HTTPS. Sandstorm.io and all of its subdomains have always required HTTPS. The Chrome team is planning to <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure">show a broken padlock</a> for plain HTTP sites. Companies that are responsible for a lot of user data have been making time to secure their sites with HTTPS.</p>

<h3 id="our-search-for-a-certificate-vendor">Our search for a certificate vendor</h3>

<p>Providing automatic HTTPS is more than just a technical problem. To be trusted, the certificates must come from a Certificate Authority that is already trusted by your browser. To deliver certificates to you, we needed to work with such an authority.</p>

<p>So, earlier this year, I began to talk to people at CAs. But there was a complication: Sandstorm <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/administering/wildcard/">requires a wildcard certificate</a> to achieve some of its security properties. That is, if your server is <code>example.sandcats.io</code>, all subdomains <code>*.example.sandcats.io</code> must be covered as well. Wildcard certificates are usually expensive – an order of magnitude more so than normal certificates. And when I talked to the inspiring folks at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>, I discovered that they weren’t ready to issue wildcard certificates.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to find Michael Trotta at <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/">GlobalSign</a>. He believed in our mission of making servers safe and easy for more people to run. Working together, we were able to set up a deal allowing us to offer free wildcard certificates under sandcats.io. Contracts were signed, and then it was time to write some code.</p>

<h3 id="defending-against-the-next-heartbleed-weekly-key-rotation">Defending against the next Heartbleed: Weekly key rotation</h3>

<p>We want Sandstorm to require as little maintenance as possible, so that there’s no reason not to run your own server. We especially want security problems to be solved with no action on your part.</p>

<p>One of the biggest headaches for server admins in recent memory was <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a>, a bug in the popular OpenSSL library which could have revealed people’s private encryption keys to attackers.</p>

<p>Patching the bug is the easy part: If you have automatic updates enabled, your Sandstorm will be updated within 24 hours of any release without any action on your part.</p>

<p>What made Heartbleed so bad, though, was not just that systems had to be updated, but that all HTTPS keys and certificates had to be revoked and regenerated, in case they had already been stolen. This was a huge pain for sysadmins, and a huge pain for the certificate revocation infrastructure, which was not designed for everyone in the world to revoke certificates simultaneously.</p>

<p>To solve this, Sandcats issues certificates valid for only seven days. Your server will automatically generate a new key and receive a new certificate every week. So, any compromise of your private key “fixes itself” over time. Granted, a week is a long time to live with the possibility of an active MITM attack, but realistically it took much longer than that for most revocations to take effect after Heartbleed (if they ever took effect at all).</p>

<h3 id="the-result-every-sandstorm-app-is-secure-for-self-hosters">The result: Every Sandstorm app is secure for self-hosters</h3>

<p>Because Sandstorm handles HTTPS, rather than the app or the system administrator, the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/h37dm17aa89yrd8zuqpdn36p6zntumtv08fjpu8a8zrte7q1cn60">Etherpad package</a> in Sandstorm doesn’t need to have any kind of special integration, nor does the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/vfnwptfn02ty21w715snyyczw0nqxkv3jvawcah10c6z7hj1hnu0">Rocket.Chat package</a>, nor does the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/sptx6z162fp1w8rwe92vc8tzm76v0mk0wwc9yafze2vpghjs48j0">Brainstorm package</a>, nor any other.</p>

<p>So take a moment and <a href="https://sandstorm.io/install/">install Sandstorm now</a> to securely enjoy these kinds of apps, or at least <a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io">try the online demo</a>.</p>

<p>And if you already have a Sandcats-enabled install of Sandstorm from before today, check out the <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/administering/ssl/">documentation</a> to enable HTTPS!</p>
