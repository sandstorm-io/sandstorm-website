  <h2><a href="/news/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis">Free publicity for your indie web app, and free Oasis service for you</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis">05 Feb 2016</a>
  
  
  
  
  <p>Every useful web app deserves users and publicity. Every author deserves an easy way to see their app the way their users see it on Sandstorm.</p>

<p>So here’s the deal: If you write an open source web app, and you package it for Sandstorm, I’ll help people discover your app and use it. You’ll also get credit toward one year of <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io"><strong>Oasis managed hosting</strong></a> so you can test your app on Sandstorm. The offer applies to anyone who successfully submits an app to the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io">Sandstorm App Market</a>, whether or not you’re the original author. It doesn’t have to be open source, though we do love open source. The Oasis hosting can be used for anything you like.</p>

<h3 id="a-sandstorm-package-allows-people-to-use-your-app-even-if-you-dont-maintain-a-public-service">A Sandstorm package allows people to use your app even if you don’t maintain a public service</h3>

<p>When I asked <a href="http://simon.vansintjan.net/">Simon Vansintjan</a> why he made a Sandstorm package of his <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/wupmzqk4872vgsye9t9x5dmrdw17mad97dk21jvcm2ph4jataze0">Quick Survey</a> app, he told me, “I have no interest in running a SaaS of every small app that I think would be a benefit [to other people].”</p>

<p>Simon wants to publish code, not commit to maintaining a service. Simon wrote Quick Survey so he could run one particular survey, as well as for the joy of learning Meteor.</p>

<p>By packaging his app for Sandstorm, he got multiple document support without writing any code. Simon said, “Once I understood that [multi-document] translated really well to how Sandstorm views apps / grains, I figured it made a lot of sense to port it to Sandstorm. I’m happy I ended up trying to port it, because it opened up how easy it would be to get other apps up and running with it.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/wupmzqk4872vgsye9t9x5dmrdw17mad97dk21jvcm2ph4jataze0"><img src="/news/images/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis/cbd94e8d81ed9bccaf19eb0228dbf451.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /></a></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/wupmzqk4872vgsye9t9x5dmrdw17mad97dk21jvcm2ph4jataze0">try out Quick Survey with a click.</a> Your app could be that easy to spin up.</p>

<p>Quick Survey is a web app that isn’t a business, and Sandstorm is perfect for apps like that. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/frigginglorious">Daniel Kraft</a> is nearly done packaging up his personal D&amp;D dice rolling app. What hobby apps have you made that others might enjoy?</p>

<h3 id="publicity-graphics-app-demo-outreach-and-more">Publicity: Graphics, app demo, outreach, and more</h3>

<p>When your app is on the Sandstorm app market, it’s naturally in front of people who use Sandstorm every day. Universities, corporations, non-profits, and self-hosting enthusiasts alike spend huge amounts of time in apps on Sandstorm.</p>

<p>Beyond that, every Sandstorm app is supported by the Sandstorm.io community team — Néna, Jade, and me.</p>

<p>Néna supports open source web app developers by <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-11-10-icons-spks-for-everyone#graphics-for-everyone">providing graphics</a> for any app with a Sandstorm package. Here are some of the graphics she’s put together:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/news/images/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis/10-appdesigns.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /></p>

<p>All three of us spend every day thinking about how to get more people using the apps in the Sandstorm ecosystem. The apps are what what make Sandstorm interesting. So we do things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Give every app a free, live demo service. This one goes to Hacker Slides. It could go to your app. <a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io/appdemo/7qvcjh7gk0rzdx1s3c8gufd288sesf6vvdt297756xcv4q8xxvhh"><img alt="Try Hacker Slides on Sandstorm" src="/news/images/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis/try-live%20demo-783189.svg" style="max-width: 92;" /></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://opensource.com/life/14/8/sandstorm-open-source-web-apps">Write</a> <a href="https://opensource.com/life/16/1/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code">articles</a> <a href="https://opensource.com/life/15/12/5-open-source-web-apps-self-hosted">for</a> outlets like opensource.com, reaching many thousands of readers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write about new apps in our <a href="https://sandstorm.io/#join-list">monthly newsletter</a>, seen by thousands of subscribers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encourage Sandstorm community members to <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-12-17-community-talks">give talks</a> about their favorite apps and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/topics/sandstorm/">organize meetups.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-01-22-8-new-open-source-apps">blog posts about new apps</a>, frequently seen on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11022993">Hacker News</a> (thanks to Andy for submitting the most recent one!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find organizations that care about specific apps, and explain to them in person how the community’s apps plus self-hosting it would help the organization achieve its mission.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Sandstorm <a href="https://sandstorm.io/community">community</a> as a whole will give you feedback on your app if you email the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev">sandstorm-dev group</a>. Check out these <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sandstorm-dev/YNiAzlqON40">recent</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sandstorm-dev/nVu9VBNFNUM">threads</a> to see how it works.</p>

<p>I want self-hosting to be a meaningful alternative to software as a service. You can be part of that movement by packaging your app for Sandstorm. If your app is written using Meteor, I’ll even create the <a href="one-click-installers-for-everyone">initial packaging</a>.</p>

<h3 id="see-what-users-see-with-a-free-power-user-account-on-oasis">See what users see, with a free Power User account on Oasis</h3>

<p>Your users probably don’t know how to deploy your app, which is why they need Sandstorm. I want you to be able to see what your users see, so I’ll give you <a href="https://sandstorm.io/get"><strong>a free year of Power User level on Oasis</strong></a> managed hosting if you write or package an app for Sandstorm.</p>

<p>While you’re on Oasis, feel free to enjoy it for anything else within the usual terms and conditions. Take advantage of private git repositories with <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/d9ygf47xrtnw12j92cyt6cu8ut75esx01u4q3kcrn8415w9qzzgh">gogs</a>, project task tracking with <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h">Wekan</a>, or privacy-preserving web analytics with <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/xuajusd5d4a9v4js71ru0cwj9wn984q1x8kny10htsp8f5dcfep0">Piwik</a>. I’ll also give you an invite to <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> so when people install your apps, they can verify your identity via the world’s most usable interface to PGP.</p>

<p>To take advantage of this offer, visit <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/">Oasis</a> and upgrade to any paid plan, knowing that all the paid plans
are free-of-cost while Sandstorm is in beta. Then email me at community@sandstorm.io to request a statement credit equal to the cost of a Power User account. We’ll add it to your account, and you’ll be all set.</p>

<h3 id="to-get-started-read-the-docs-or-email-me">To get started, read the docs, or email me</h3>

<p>Every good web app deserves users and publicity. I’m here to help you with that.</p>

<p>You can dive right in by reading the <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/packaging-tutorial/">packaging tutorial</a>. Sandstorm supports any language/stack that runs on Linux, and has special <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/platform-stacks/">tooling</a> for nodejs, PHP/MySQL, Meteor, and Python.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure, or you just want to chat, or you’re waiting on us to publish your app, it’d be my honor to hear from you. Send me an email at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#099;&#111;&#109;&#109;&#117;&#110;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#064;&#115;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#115;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#109;&#046;&#105;&#111;">&#099;&#111;&#109;&#109;&#117;&#110;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#064;&#115;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#115;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#109;&#046;&#105;&#111;</a>!</p>

    - <a href="/news/2016-02-03-hn-highlights">03 Feb 2016</a>
  
  <p>While <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-01-22-8-new-open-source-apps">my previous blog post</a> was discussed on Hacker News yesterday, <em>andybak</em> asked to “hear from people that are using Sandstorm day to day.” <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11023300">Reading the replies</a> really made me appreciate the warmth of the <a href="https://sandstorm.io/community">Sandstorm community</a>, and I just wanted to share a few excerpts.</p>

<p>Nolan Darilek writes:</p>

<blockquote class="notbig">
  <p>I use Sandstorm daily. Private/company projects are run in <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/zx9d3pt0fjh4uqrprjftgpqfwgzp6y2ena6098ug3ctv37uv6kfh">Gitlab</a> instances, though I may switch to <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/6va4cjamc21j0znf5h5rrgnv0rpyvh1vaxurkrgknefvj0x63ash">Gitweb</a> if a minor cosmetic issue is resolved  (Gitweb in Sandstorm can only host one repo by design but you still have to click through to it when viewing the instance, which is mildly annoying when all other apps come up ready to use.)</p>

  <p>I have a bunch of <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h">Wekan</a> boards managing everything from coding projects to my GTD buckets to separate boards for random home improvement projects. I prefer Wekan to spreadsheets because I can track work through arbitrary workflows and annotate items with additional data, and Sandstorm lets me manage that without having to maintain and secure a separate Wekan server that any random person could find and exploit. My blog is hosted in <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/aax9j672p6z8n7nyupzvj2nmumeqd4upa0f7mgu8gprwmy53x04h">Sandstorm WordPress</a> so I have the niceness of its admin interface but none of its security risks, and all the speed of a static site. A small 2-person bootstrapped startup I’ve cofounded uses it for many of the same use cases plus hosting our app’s <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/xuajusd5d4a9v4js71ru0cwj9wn984q1x8kny10htsp8f5dcfep0">Piwik</a> instance, again so there’s literally no non-Sandstorm-secured user-facing attack surface other than Piwik’s API endpoint. I have an idea for a platform co-op in the middle distant future, and if I manage to launch it then I’ll run it via Sandstorm-hosted Loomio, which I’m actively attempting to port and am fairly close to completing.</p>

  <p>Sandstorm is a great platform, and the community comprises some of the nicest, most dedicated folks I know. When my cofounder messed up our install a bit, Kenton talked us through fixing it on a weekend no less, right down to giving us database queries to run and then patching Sandstorm to handle our edge case the next week. Awesome people.</p>

  <p>At some point some crazy mofo is going to post it to hackernews.

  <p>I posted a URL for that station to my work’s Slack, and then people started uploading stuff and rocking out. We’ve had a great time taking turns DJing, sharing our musical taste with each other, and hijacking the stream when it gets too boring or weird. I’ve had friends of mine jump on from elsewhere in the world, some who I haven’t seen in years, and drop their music on us. We’re completely in love with this – it’s a way for us to stay connected through music without disturbing the people who just want to work quietly.</p>

  <p>I’m astounded at how easy Sandstorm made this whole thing. These guys continue to blow me away with their ability to create incredibly useful experiences on a small budget and in such a short time.</p>

<p>Did you know that you can get bonus storage on Oasis through the <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/referrals">referral program</a>?</p>

<p>Unlock up to 30GB if you’re a paid user, or up to 2GB bonus storage (+ unlimited grains) for free tier users. (Technically, all plans are free right now while we’re in beta, so catch that while you can.)  That bonus storage will come in handy when you switch over to <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/8aspz4sfjnp8u89000mh2v1xrdyx97ytn8hq71mdzv4p4d8n0n3h">Davros</a> like me.</p>

  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-01-20-how-it-works">20 Jan 2016</a>
  
  <p style="text-align: center"><a href="/how-it-works"><img src="/images/how-it-works.png" /></a></p>

<p>Last week <a href="/news/2016-01-11-website">we announced the launch of our new web site</a>. Everything has changed!</p>

<p>Today, I want to call your attention to one page that I’m particularly excited to have written: <a href="/how-it-works">The “How it works” page</a>. Sandstorm is radically different from all other web infrastructure you might be familiar with, in that we containerize not just “microservices” but individual documents. As it turns out, this has all kinds of huge advantages, especially in terms of security but also in the ability to compose apps into larger workflows. Read all about it here:</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-01-11-website">The new Sandstorm.io website</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-01-11-website">11 Jan 2016</a>
  
  <p>If you take a look at <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">https://sandstorm.io/</a>, you’ll see our new website, created by Néna Nguyen with assistance from Kenton Varda. They took feedback from many users and the core dev team over the course of building it, and we’re all going to keep adjusting it over time. If you have feedback, please share it with the community in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev">sandstorm-dev mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to highlight a few important things the new website does better when compared to the old website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213145657/https://sandstorm.io/">available at the Internet Archive</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Responsive design.</strong> If you view the new website on a phone, you’ll get something reasonable. This wasn’t true a year ago, and it required some thinking. If you’re new to responsive web design, start by reading <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">Ethan Marcotte’s article at A List Apart</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Flexbox.</strong> We use the new <code>display: flex;</code> layout mode so that we can express columns very naturally in CSS. So far we’re very happy with it. You can read up about it at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes">MDN</a> or by playing <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a>, an interactive learning game. You can also read our CSS on the <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-website">GitHub repository for the website</a> to find out how we use it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SCSS/SASS.</strong> We now use a CSS extension language called <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a>. This lets us use features like variables and nesting. You can see how we use it in the <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-website">sandstorm-website GitHub repository</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Multiple pages.</strong> The older Sandstorm.io website had just one page: index.html. The new site goes into more depth about <a href="https://sandstorm.io/how-it-works">how Sandstorm works</a>, how to <a href="https://sandstorm.io/community">get involved in the community</a>. how <a href="https://sandstorm.io/business">businesses can make the best use of Sandstorm</a>, and more. It was time to have more than one page. A side note: if you hear us talking about how the “front page redesign” is finally done, this is because we’re used to the entire website being one page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A button to sign in to Oasis, our hosting service.</strong> Sandstorm is open source software that anyone can install; since not everyone wants to install it, <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/">oasis.sandstorm.io</a> is our hosting service where you can run Sandstorm apps without your own server. The new “sign-in” link above the fold makes it easy to log into our Oasis hosting service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>One repository for the blog and the website.</strong> Until now, we maintained the Sandstorm blog separately, with its own templates and no version control. Kenton built the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/nqmcqs9spcdpmqyuxemf0tsgwn8awfvswc58wgk375g4u25xv6yh">Hacker CMS</a> app for this purpose. Now that the main website uses Jekyll, we’ve integrated our old blog posts into the main <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-website">sandstorm-website</a> git repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A simpler top banner.</strong> In the previous website, the banner at the top of the site would allow you to subscribe to our Facebook page, or try a demo, or download Sandstorm, or sign up now for the Oasis hosting service. We’ve limited the number of options to help people learn more faster.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the most essential changes. You’ll find a lot of subtle changes as you click around <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">the new site</a> and compare it to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213145657/https://sandstorm.io/">the old one!</a> If you have comments, consider <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-website/issues">filing a bug</a> or emailing <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev">sandstorm-dev</a>. Kudos to Néna Nguyen and Kenton Varda for getting these changes ready in record time.</p>
